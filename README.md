Solvers and accessories for Off-Resonant cascaded absorption quantum memories.

This package is currently written for Python 2.7, and all Python commands should use this version (until a new release happens). The following commands assume a UNIX-like OS.

Installation
============
Clone and install using pip:

    $ git clone https://github.com/oscarlazoarjona/orca_memories
    $ pip install orca_memories/

To upgrade to a newer version:

    $ cd orca_memories
    orca_memories$ git pull
    orca_memories$ pip install . --upgrade


To uninstall:

    $ pip uninstall orca_memories

Using orca_memories
===================

To run any of the examples go to the `orca_memories/examples/` directory and run Python on them. The examples will output plots and other files to the corresponding folders in the examples folder.
